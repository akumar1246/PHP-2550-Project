# Introduction

In the United States, roughly 2.1-2.4 million individuals are diagnosed with human campylobacteriosis. These bacteria strains are classified as infectious diseases, and the broader symptoms of being infected include dysentery, abdominal cramping, etc [KN1] [10]. While less common, such strains, specifically that of Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), can also result in septic arthritis, a condition which infects the joints11. The strain of C. jejuni is most frequently reported in the United States, and is defined as the root cause of foodborne disease.

In this repository, we use secondary data on the foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni to conduct an analysis investigating risk factors of outbreaks.


# Data

In this section, we have two data sources. The first dataset titled "isolates.csv" is downloaded from the "Isolates" browser of the National Library of Medicine's (NIH) NCBI Pathogen Detection Project which is located at:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#taxgroup_name:%22Campylobacter%20jejuni%22

The second dataset titled "NationalOutbreakPublicDataTool.csv" is downloaded from the CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) and contains data on the state, year, and month, of all Campylobacter jejuni outbreaks in the United States from 2012-2020. This dataset can be found here:
